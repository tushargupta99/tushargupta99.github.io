					Hello Everyone!!
					  B.Tech Final Yr. student. Highly enthusiastic towards upcoming techcnology trends. Love to explore latest gEEK stuff in the market.
					Currently, getting training as a <span class="spl_text">MEAN Stack Web Developer</span> 
					from Edwisor and learing how to design front end part of a website. I opt this as my career because I love new upcoming tech, how applications and websites flow with such a smoothness on any gadget and how everything is inter-connected to each other and works in sync.
					I love music especially by Eminem, Charlie Puth, Camila Cabello. Always start my day with <span class="spl_text">Mood Booster</span> playlist on <span class="spl_text">Spotify.</span><br>When I work, I would like to concentrate totally on it with a cup of coffee on my table. I prefer to work in a team with a group of mentaly-healthy, passionate people who are dedicated towards living life to the fullest along with work.<br><br>	Apart from this, I love Video Gaming.  A big fan of Counter Strike GO, DOTA 2 kind-of games where patience, team-work and stategy-making capabilities are tested. In my free time you can also find me working out in Gym, or in a pub chillin' out with my friends.

		    	<p class="experience_description">
		    		I have a basic experience of using Android Studio. Before choosing Web Development as my career, I use to develop and know more about android apps how they work.<br>
		    		I used to refer official documentation for learning Android Studio Tools and how to work with apis, Firebase, ArrayAdapter, etc.
		    		I also joined Udacity courses to learn more about them step by step.
		    		I know how to use Google sites to create a basic website with in no time and how to use Microsoft Office products with quite good efficiency.<br>
		    		<a class="cfts" href="https://github.com/tushargupta99/Certificates/blob/master/M001%20-%20Course%20Completion%20Confirmation.pdf">I know about MongoDB, MongoDB ATLAS, MongoDB COMPASS, Document Query Language and how to use shell to execeute Queries and other CRUD operations. I know how to create CLUSTER, deploy it on ATLAS and use Monitoring Agents to Monitor, Backup and other Alerts features of ATLAS.</a><br><br>
		    		2 years ago, I did php course, where I learned how to build webpages and link them with one another. I developed a basic website(based on facebook) which uses authentication to authorise the existing user and also allows to create account for new user and see their friends in Friend list.<br>
		    		Though I don't have any professional experience in Web related field, nor I did any free_lancer kind of thing but I will give my 100% for edwisor assignments and industry based projects and my experience column is going to expand very soon.

		    	<p class="projects_description">
		    		As far as projects are concerned, Currently I am working on a Portfolio Website where I made 4-5 sections describing my career progress and other related interests.
		    		I decided to build this website step by step and not directly jumping to the coding part.<br>
		    		At the very beginning, I carefully read the question and analysed what is to develop. By keeping all the 4-5 mentioned points in the mind, I use pen and paper to highlight what to include in the Website, and try to build a rough sketch.
		    		Then I take a look on some professional portfilio websites thoroughly and understood how to think before building something new.
		    		I draw several samples of my web-page and then compare everyone, discussed them with my friends who are already in Web Development field.<br><br>
		    		Then again I visited to several websites to check how fonts, headings, titles, images, navigation-bars, margins, etc are used on a webpage and then draw an updated template on paper including details about spacing, margins, paddings and built a rough sketch and then I collected data to be included in the website. I decide to keep everything organised from the very beginning therefore all the images, icons, logos were placed in their repective hierarchical folders.<br>
		    		Before starting the coding part, I build a final sketch on a paper and start working according to it by keeping in mind all the responsive website elements.
		    		On inclusion of every element, I check the responsiveness by changing the size of browser window and try to handle it efficiently.		    		
		    		During the development phase, I found difficulties related to multiple font sizes and bulkyness of my CSS file. It took a while for me to build it, but I think, I figured that out. I started using class and ids properly along with mediaqueries and flexbox concepts. By giving proper and logical name to every HTML element, it become easy to use CSS properties more effectively with higher efficiency.
		    		<br><br>
		    		On each milestone or problem arousal, I made a habbit to commit the updated code on GIT, so that  later it become easy for me to change something, and also for anyone trying understand the code with minimum efforts.
